# Experiments on the Toulouse Hyperspectral Data Set

This repository contains the code to reproduce the experiments of the paper:

[R. Thoreau, L. Risser, V. Achard, B. Berthelot and X. Briottet, "Toulouse Hyperspectral Data Set: a benchmark data set to assess semi-supervised spectral representation learning and pixel-wise classification techniques", 2023.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.08863.pdf)

Please cite this paper if you use the code in this repository as part of a published research project (see bibtex citation below).

The [Toulouse Hyperspectral Data Set](https://www.toulouse-hyperspectral-data-set.com/) is the combination of 1) an airborne hyperspectral image acquired by the AisaFENIX sensor over Toulouse, France, during the [CAMCATT-AI4GEO campaign](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340923002287) and of 2) a land cover ground truth, provided with standard train / test splits for the validation of machine learning models.
